Developed sometime early 2024.

Before 2024 on Roblox, it was decently common for games to implement unsafe math.random practices. For one example, (the example that led to the creation of this tool) a game called Oaklands used the same RNG generator for determining rare items as they did for their "Randomizer" logic component. This specific case obviously doesn't work today.
